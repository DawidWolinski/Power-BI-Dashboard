This is an interactive Power BI dashboard about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It shows total, as well as per capit and per GDP data, by location (country/continent), year and source of emission.

All data was taken from "Our World in Data": https://github.com/owid/co2-data


Raw data was cleaned by removing columns with data which can be calculated using DAX, such as cumulative or per capita data. Then it was normalised and split into 5 tables (as in the diagram below).
